FODLAM Networks as JSON
=======================

This directory contains network specifications from around the Web. The network spec is converted from Caffe prototxt files (Protobuf's text format) to JSON.

The directory also contains the infrastructure used to fetch the data and perform the configuration, but the JSON files are included here to make FODLAM self-contained.
